# Bitcoin Management System (BMS)

## Vision
The Bitcoin Management System (BMS) is an open-source platform designed to be the "WordPress of Bitcoin" - a modular, plugin-based system that makes Bitcoin adoption seamless for businesses and individuals. BMS provides a unified interface to manage all aspects of Bitcoin operations, from daily spending to long-term treasury management.

## Core Principles
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with transparent processes
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design allowing specialized functionality
- **Security First**: Implementing Bitcoin's highest security standards while keeping them invisible to users
- **Sovereignty**: Always prioritizing self-custody and user control
- **Simplicity**: Making Bitcoin operations accessible without technical jargon

## Core Plugins
- **Payment Reception**: Accept Bitcoin payments via on-chain and Lightning Network
- **Lightning Spending Wallet**: Manage everyday Bitcoin transactions
- **Operations Fund**: Cold storage for business operations
- **Treasury Fund**: Multi-signature setup for long-term holdings
- **Bitcoin Node**: Connection to the Bitcoin network with optional Lightning support

## Development Approach
This project is being developed with a lean MVP approach, focusing initially on the dashboard interface and core plugin architecture. We're combining Bitcoin security expertise with modern development practices to create a system that grows with the community.

## Current Status
We're in the early development stages, building the foundational architecture and initial plugins. Contributors and feedback are welcome!
